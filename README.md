# Personal_Projects
My little secret diary but with code

## C
These are my *relevant* C projects. Most of them don't have a practical use, I've made them just for fun or in order to learn something.

### Calc
A simple calculator implemented with a Lexical analyzer and recursive descent parser to process and evaluate the user's input.

### MazeGenerator
An implementation of a randomized version of Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm (src: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Prim.27s_algorithm).
